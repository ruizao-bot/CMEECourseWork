    Performs a decrement on the input `x` and divides the original `x` by the updated value `y` in a loop.

    Parameters:
    x (int): The input integer to be processed.

    Returns:
    float: The result of the division of `x` by `y` in each iteration of the loop.

    Note:
    This function contains a bug. If `x` is larger than 0, the loop will eventually attempt to divide by zero, 
    causing a `ZeroDivisionError`.
